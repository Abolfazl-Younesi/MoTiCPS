## Overview
<!--
This repository contains the implementation and associated resources for the paper **"MoTiCPS: Energy Optimization on Multi-Objective Task Scheduling in IoT-Integrated Cyber-Physical Systems"** by Abolfazl Younesi, Elyas Oustad, Mohsen Ansari, Mohammad Abolnejadian, and Alireza Ejlali, published in *IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Computing* in August 2024.

MoTiCPS introduces a novel approach for task scheduling and resource allocation in fog computing environments, designed explicitly for IoT-integrated cyber-physical systems (CPS). The method leverages the Osprey Optimization Algorithm (OOA) to improve task reliability, balance resource use across edge devices, and optimize the performance of fog nodes under real-time constraints.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Objective Optimization**: MoTiCPS optimizes for multiple objectives, including energy consumption, task makespan, and reliability.
- **Task Scheduling Algorithm**: A novel scheduling algorithm based on the Osprey Optimization Algorithm (OOA) ensures efficient task execution and resource management.
- **Reliability Enhancement**: The method employs a primary/backup fault-tolerance technique to enhance task reliability and system robustness.
- **Energy Efficiency**: The approach significantly reduces energy consumption in IoT-integrated CPS, making it suitable for energy-constrained environments.


## Requirements
- **iFogSim**: simulations may require the iFogSim simulator for fog computing, a Java-based tool.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MoTiCPS.git
   ```


You can adjust the configurations in the JSON file to change the parameters such as the number of tasks, fog nodes, energy settings, etc.
